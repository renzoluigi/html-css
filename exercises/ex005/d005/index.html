  <h2>Who am I?</h2>

  <p>Hi, my name is Sofia Marques, I'm 18 years old, and my birthday is October 30th.
    I graduated from high school in 2024 and am now studying to join the military. I'm taking a Military Strategies course and dream of a military career.
    I have a boyfriend named Renzo Luigi, and he is my greatest confidant. He's my closest person and the one I trust most on this earth, I think, even more than my parents.
    Apart from my relationship, I'm quiet and observant, yet full of humor, a dry wit. If I feel comfortable, I talk a lot, but I have difficulty talking to new people.
    I have an obsession with organization; even though my room is always messy, I can't work in a disorganized environment.
    My relationship with my parents is healthy; we talk a lot, and I feel loved. I have a sister who is the complete opposite of me, but I love her very much too. Overall, my family is huge, but it's very close-knit. I'm very much a family person; I enjoy having guests over and preparing something special.
    I enjoy crafts: painting, sewing, drawing, writing... I like to call myself a craftswoman.
    I love going to church; I think it's my favorite part of the week. I love singing hymns, talking to the youth, feeling God's presence, being inside the church—it all makes me feel good.
    Aside from that, I love being with my boyfriend, spending time with him. Or when we're apart, I like it when he calls me, hearing his voice and talking, video calling and studying together, or sleeping over the phone and knowing he's okay.
    When I'm not with my boyfriend, I spend most of my time alone, and I also love my own company. Visits are nice, but only for a few hours; after a while, I get tired of them and like being alone.
    I love the sea, water, pools, rivers—anything like that. I'm a naturalist; I love and respect nature and everything it offers... my mother's creation.
    I'm affectionate but sometimes stupid. I don't hold grudges and I hate disagreements.
    Anyway, I had a lot to say, but my boyfriend is rushing me. Bye.</p>
