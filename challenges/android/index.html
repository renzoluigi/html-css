            <h1>Android mascot history</h1>
            <p>You probably know that <strong>Google's Android</strong> operating system is one of the most widely used
                mobile devices
                worldwide.
                But perhaps you didn't know that its friendly mascot had a name and an alluring story? Well, follow
                this
                article to learn a lot about this little robot.
            </p>

            <h2>First version</h2>
            <p>
                The first attempt at creating a mascot came in 2007 from a developer named <a class = "link"
                    href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103">Dan
                Morrill</a>. He says he opened
                <a class="link" href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a> (free software for vectorizing
                images) and created his own robot. The goal was to personify the
                system
                for his team; there was no request from the company to create a mascot.

            </picture>
            <p>This first bizarre version was even named after its creator: they would be the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>A new mascot arises</h2>
            <p>The idea of having a mascot matured, and the task was passed on to a professional in the field. Russian
                illustrator <a class="link" href="https://www.irinablok.com">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, was
                tasked with representing the little robot in a more
                appealing way.
            </p>
            <picture>
                <source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="media/images/irina-blok-pq.jpg" type="image/jpg">
                <img src="media/images/irina-blok.jpg" alt="Irina Blok">
            </picture>
            <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with fewer lines and in a flatter way. The drawing
                should also be easily identifiable to anyone who sees it. Thus, <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, Android's new
                mascot, was
                born.
            </p>
            <img id="bugdroid" src="media/images/bugdroid.png" alt="Bug droid">
            <p>The main inspiration for the new Bugdroid's design came from those little figures that illustrate bathroom
                doors
                to indicate the type of door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in the Google office
                and
                looked at the restrooms, and the idea was immediately recognizable: simple, clean, and to the point.

            <p>Another curious thing about Android is that each version has always been named after a sweet, in alphabetical
                order from version 1.5 to 9.0.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, <a href="#">Android Q</a> never happened, as Google decided to end this fun practice and began using
                numbering, which gave rise to <a href="#">Android 10</a>.</p>
